# CollegeSchedule
A very simple, yet powerful script. The script fixed a major problem many FERIT students used to face on a daily basis, and was met with amazing reactions across the board, reaching more than a hundred clicks within the first day of hosting. Appallingly bad desing of our college's website made it hard and gruesome to reach your course schedule and worst of all it could not be bookmarked. This script fixed all of these problems and has changed life of my fellow students for the better.
